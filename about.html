    <div>Scott Enders is a champion of Ogilvy style advertising, also known as the "golden age" of advertising, refers to the era of advertising in the mid-20th century that was characterized by its focus on creativity, storytelling, and emotional appeals. 
      This style of advertising, popularized by David Ogilvy, was based on the principles of consumer psychology and the studies of Sigmund Freud, which emphasized the importance of understanding and appealing to consumers' subconscious desires and motivations. 
      In this era, advertisements were crafted with meticulous attention to detail, using carefully chosen words, images, and colors to create a specific emotional response in the viewer.
